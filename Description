#Features
Synthetic Data Generation: Creates a mock dataset that mimics real-world employee demographic and financial data
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, filters outliers, and converts categorical features into a numerical format using One-Hot Encoding.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Generates various plots (histograms, count plots) to visualize and understand the data distributions and relationships between features.
Model Training: Trains a RandomForestClassifier to predict if an employee's income is above or below the $50K threshold.
Model Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using standard metrics such as Accuracy, Classification Report, and a Confusion Matrix.
Batch Prediction: Demonstrates how to use the trained model to make predictions on new, unseen data, showcasing its practical application.

#Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed.

pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
numpy

#Installation
You can install all the required libraries using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy
Usage
The code is structured as a series of cells, perfect for execution in a Jupyter Notebook or similar environment. Simply copy and paste each code block into a new cell and run them in sequential order.

The script will:
Generate a synthetic dataset.
Print data previews and information on missing values.
Display several data visualization plots.
Perform data preprocessing and split the data for training.
Train the Random Forest model and print evaluation metrics.
Generate and print predictions for a small batch of new employee data.

#Code Structure and Workflow
The project is organized into several key functions and steps that form a standard machine learning workflow:
generate_synthetic_data(): Creates the initial DataFrame with mock employee information.
preprocess_data(): Cleans the data, handles missing values, and performs feature engineering (e.g., One-Hot Encoding).
Main Workflow (Cell-by-Cell):
Data Generation: Creates the initial DataFrame.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizes key data features and relationships.
Data Preprocessing: Applies the cleaning and encoding steps.
Data Splitting: Divides the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Initializes and fits the Random Forest Classifier.
Model Evaluation: Computes and displays performance metrics on the test set.
Batch Prediction: Uses the trained model to predict the income category for new, unlabelled data points.

Example Output
When you run the final cells, you will see output similar to the following, showing the predictions for the new employee data:
