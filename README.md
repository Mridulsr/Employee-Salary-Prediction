# Employee-Salary-Prediction
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline for employee salary prediction using a Random Forest Classifier. The entire workflow, from data generation and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and new data prediction, is contained within a single, well-structured Python script.

The project is designed to be highly modular, with each logical step broken down into separate, self-contained components, making it ideal for educational purposes or for use in an interactive environment like a Jupyter Notebook.
